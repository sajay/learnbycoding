#This problem was asked by Apple.
# Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, 
# and calls f after n milliseconds.

# First, let's try the most straightforward solution. 
# That would probably be to spin off a new thread on each function we want to delay, 
# sleep the requested amount, and then run the function. It might look something like this:

# While this works, there is a huge problem with this method: 
# we spin off a new thread each time we call delay! 
# That means the number of threads we use could easily explode. 
import threading
from time import sleep

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def delay(self, f, n):
        def sleep_then_call(n):
            sleep(n / 1000)
            f()
        t = threading.Thread(target=sleep_then_call)
        t.start()

# Solution # 2
# We can get around this by having only one dedicated thread to call the functions, 
# and storing the functions we need to call in some data structure. 
# In this case, we use a list. 
# We also have to do some sort of polling now to check when to run a function. 
# We can store each function along with a unix epoch timestamp that tells it when it should run by. 
# Then we'll poll some designated tick amount and check the list for any jobs that are due to be run, 
# run them, and then remove them from the list.

from time import sleep
import threading

class Scheduler2:
    def __init__(self):
        self.fns = [] # tuple of (fn, time)
        t = threading.Thread(target=self.poll)
        t.start()

    def poll(self):
        while True:
            now = time() * 1000
            for fn, due in self.fns:
                if now > due:
                    fn()
            self.fns = [(fn, due) for (fn, due) in self.fns if due > now]
            sleep(0.01)

    def delay(self, f, n):
        self.fns.append((f, time() * 1000 + n))
