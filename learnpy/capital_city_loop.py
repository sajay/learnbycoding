#Review your state capitals along with dictionaries and while loops!
#First, finish filling out the following dictionary with the remaining states and their
#associated capitals in a file called capitals.py. Or you can grab the finished file directly from the exercises folder in the course repository #on Github.
#capitals_dict = {
#'Alabama': 'Montgomery',
#'Alaska': 'Juneau',
#'Arizona': 'Phoenix',
#'Arkansas': 'Little Rock',
#'California': 'Sacramento',
#'Colorado': 'Denver',
#'Connecticut': 'Hartford',
#'Delaware': 'Dover',
#'Florida': 'Tallahassee',
#'Georgia': 'Atlanta',
#}
#Next, write a script that imports the capitals_dict variable along with the 'random'
#package:
#from capitals import capitals_dict
#import random
#This script should use a while loop to iterate through the dictionary and grab a random
#state and capital, assigning each to a variable. The user is then asked what the capital of
#the randomly picked state is. The loop continues forever, asking the user what the
#capital is, unless the user either answers correctly or types "exit".#If the user answers correctly, "Correct" is displayed after the loop ends. #However, if the user exits without guessing correctly, the answer is displayed along with "Goodbye."
#NOTE: Make sure the user is not punished for case sensitivity. In other words, a guess of "Denver" is the same as "denver". The same rings true #for exiting - "EXIT" and "Exit" are the same as "exit".
